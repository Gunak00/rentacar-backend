# RentACar - Backend

RentACar is an application developed as part of my bachelor's thesis. This README file specifically covers the backend part of the application, which is designed for car rental companies and offers two key functionalities:

## Reservation of Vehicles

Users, after logging into the application, can browse the available vehicles and make reservations for a specific duration. The reservation process is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing all necessary information such as the car model, availability, and rental price. After making a reservation, users will receive a confirmation email to their provided email address, ensuring the security and reliability of the transaction.

## Fleet Management by Administrators

Administrators can manage the fleet of vehicles, including adding new vehicles, editing the details of existing vehicles, and removing them from the system.

## Technologies Used

- Language: Java
- Framework: Spring Boot
- Database: MySQL
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Frontend

You can also find the frontend part of this application on my profile, where I have provided several screenshots of the user interface.
